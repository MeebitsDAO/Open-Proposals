Title of proposal:

MeebitsDAO Mentoring and Early Investor Program

Description:

The MeebitsDAO Mentoring and Early Investor Program is an initiative aimed at increasing revenue for the MeebitsDAO treasury and participating MeebitsDAO founders. The program would allow general membership token holders to apply for repayable grants that get distributed back to DAO founders in exchange for NFT project related services. To keep disbursements secure, grant monies could be issued in a closed-loop manor, where the DAO issues funds directly to engaged founders.

Upon sellout, grant recipients would be required to repay the funds back in-full with an additional 25% fee. If the project does not sell out within an agreed upon timeframe, grant repayment back to the DAO would be reduced. For example, if 75% of the project sold within a 30 day period, 75% of grant would be repayable. 

Structuring the MeebitsDAO Mentoring and Early Investor Program like this could serve as an important step in creating trust between the DAO and grant recipients. It should also further-incentivize founders to continue raising awareness of these projects and in-turn, keep the programâ€™s success rate high.

Lastly, just like there is no requirement to own Meebits when joining the MeebitsDAO, these projects would not necessarily have to be Meebits related. The program would be an avenue to grow the MeebitsDAO brand and act as an incubator for up-and-coming NFT artists and projects; provide additional utility for token holders; and encourage more people to join the DAO for access to the program.

Additional information:

Given that the scope of these requests would range from project to project, I recommend testing the program out with a project needing a relatively low-level of assistance in a later stage of its overall process. Furthermore, as a sign of optimism to the public, the successful candidate should also be new to the DAO and agree to act as a public ambassador for the program and the MeebitsDAO as a whole.

Previous work:

In addition to the Rarible link below, I am contributing to a middle-to-late stage PFP project with two recognized physical-world artists entering the space for the first time.

Estimated hours:

Project hours would very from candidate to candidate but for the initial tryout, MeebitsDAO involvement could be as little as having participating founders showcasing the project on socials and within private networks.

    1 x hours for internal discussion on program feasibility
    
    2 x hours for refining the program proposal
    
    2 x hours approving initial candidate(s)
    
    2 x hours to draft social media posts and generate awareness within private networks

Total: 7hrs

Price: 0-10 ETH

I would suggest starting with a 5-10 ETH drawing pool and select one or two projects that require limited resources to succeed. From there, channel attention to those successes and expand resources as needed.
